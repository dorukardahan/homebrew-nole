# Homebrew formula TEMPLATE for the dorukardahan/homebrew-nole tap.
#
# This is the reviewable source of truth. The release workflow renders it (filling
# the version and the four per-asset sha256 placeholders from the published
# SHA256SUMS) and pushes the result to Formula/nole.rb in the tap repo, so `brew install
# dorukardahan/nole/nole` always tracks the latest release. (Auto-push requires a
# HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN secret; when it is absent the release workflow skips the sync
# and the formula is bumped manually — see docs/PACKAGING.md.)
#
# Prebuilt-binary formula (NOT build-from-source): the release binary already carries
# the version/commit/date ldflags stamp, so `nole version` and `doctor
# --check-updates` report correctly. A source-build formula would print `nole dev`
# forever — do not switch to one without replicating the
# internal/version.{Version,Commit,Date} ldflags from scripts/check-release-builds.sh.
# Stanza order is FIXED by Homebrew's FormulaAudit/ComponentsOrder cop (verified
# against `brew audit --strict`): desc, homepage, version, license, livecheck,
# on_macos, on_linux, install, caveats, test. livecheck MUST precede the on_* url
# blocks and caveats MUST precede test — do not reorder.

        gh attestation verify "$(brew --prefix)/bin/nole" --repo dorukardahan/nole
